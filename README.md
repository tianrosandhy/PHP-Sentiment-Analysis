# Sistem Analisis Sentimen berbasis PHP (PHP Sentiment Analysis System)

This system is a simple PHP based system which is the final project for my bachelor degree. The main use of this system is to analyze the sentiment of the sentences inputted by users. You need to have a bunch of data training, then you can get the right sentiment of the inputted sentences.

The method used is a combination of K-Means and k-Nearest Neighbor. The accuracy rate is between 60 - 85% but it really depends by the completeness of your data training. 

### Requirement
- Recommended PHP 5.6 until 7.4
- MySQL or MariaDB database

### Installation
- Clone 
- Create new MySQL database, and import this "skripsi.sql" to your database
- Setup database connection in "dbconfig.php"
- Yes, just like that
